It\'s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure, backed up with\n                     \n                      some\n                     \n                     items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets, no elemental stats, no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough, people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game, but after a while it felt much, much easier to me than Dark Souls\n                     \n                      because\n                     \n                     there was nothing in my way except my own skill, which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\'t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better, because then it\'s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled, or I said """"screw it"""", summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly, once you get that perfect parry timing down, sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n                     \n                      almost\n                     \n                     feels unsatisfying. Happened to me with the final boss, funnily enough.', 'It only took me three playthroughs but I finally like this game! Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout, though, which isn\'t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a """"correct"""" way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble, but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\'s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\'s bad and sucks, and that\'s bad and sucks.', """"Toujours en balance avec Bloodborne et Dark Souls pour le titre de meilleur jeu de chez FromSoftware.

              The gameplay is a departure from previous entries in the series in many ways. Though it retains the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system, FFVII features three party members rather than four. The Materia system allows the player to customize each party member's abilities to their liking, and the Limit system grants them unique combat skills.;
